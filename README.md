# instrument-simulation
It is a small and flexible tool for charged particle simulations.

The tool relies on the Geant4 framework. The Geant4 license explicitly forbids to use of the name "to endorse or promote software, or products derived therefrom, except with prior written permission by license@geant4.org" https://geant4.web.cern.ch/license/LICENSE.html. Thus, there is no "Geant4" in the name. The project is small and research-related, so it does not have to be official.

Internally the project has the name "geant4-sim-gdml". It may change, but I see infinitesimal reasons to do that.
