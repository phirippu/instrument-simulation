Requirements
============

You will need Geant4, GSL libraries and Boost.

Install
=======

To install the software, create a build directory. Go to build directory and run cmake. 
If everything went well, run make -j <number of compiler threads>. Optionally, run make install

For instance:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 24
make install

Have fun, be careful.
